Let's try something.I have to go to sleep.Today is June 18th, and it is Muiriel's birthday.Muiriel is 20 now.The password is muiriel.I will be back soon.I'm at a loss for words.This is never going to end.I just don't know what to say.That was an evil bunny.I was in the mountains.Is it a recent picture?I don't know if I have the time.Education in this world disappoints me.You're in better shape than I am.You are in my way.This will cost $30.I make $100 a day.I may give up soon and just nap instead.It's because you don't want to be alone.That won't happen.Sometimes he can be a strange guy.I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.I suppose it's different when you think about it over the long term.I miss you.I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.I always liked mysterious characters more.You should sleep.I'm going to go.I told them to send me another ticket.You're so impatient with me.I can't live that kind of life.I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.I never liked biology.The last person I told my idea to thought I was nuts.If the world weren't in the shape, it is now I could trust anyone.It is unfortunately true.They are too busy fighting against each other to care for common ideals.Most people think I'm crazy.No, I'm not you are.That's my line.He's kicking me.Are you sure?Then there is a problem.Oh, there's a butterfly.Hurry up!It doesn't surprise me.For some reason, I feel more alive at night.It depends on the context.Are you freaking kidding me?That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.I don't want to be lame, I want to be cool.When I grow up, I want to be a king.America is a lovely place to be if you are here to earn money.I'm so fat.So what?I'm gonna shoot him.I'm not a real fish, I'm just a mere plushy.I'm just saying.That was probably what influenced their decision.I've always wondered what it'd be like to have siblings.This is what I would have said.It would take forever for me to explain everything.That's because you're a girl.Sometimes I can't help showing emotions.It's a word I'd like to find a substitute for.It would be something I'd have to program.I don't intend to be selfish.Let's consider the worst that could happen.How many close friends do you have?I may be antisocial, but it doesn't mean I don't talk to people.This is always the way it has been.I think it is best not to be impolite.One can always find time.I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.When I woke up, I was sad.That is somewhat explained at the end.I thought you liked to learn new things.Most people write about their daily life.If I could send you a marshmallow trang, I would.In order to do that, you have to take risks.Every person who is alone is alone because they are afraid of others.Why do you ask?I am not an artist, I never had the knack for it.I can't tell her now it's not that simple anymore.I am a flawed person, but these are flaws that can easily be fixed.Whenever I find something I like, it's too expensive.How long did you stay?Maybe it will be exactly the same for him.Innocence is a beautiful thing.Humans were never meant to live forever.I don't want to lose my ideas even though some of them are a bit extreme.I think I have a theory about that.That is intriguing.You are saying you intentionally hide your good looks.I do not have an account in these forums.If anyone was to ask what the point of the story is, I really don't know.I didn't know where it came from.
